# 🧠 TensorFlow Lite0 Object Detection Demo (for Chalkak App)

> **An Android demo app showcasing object detection using TensorFlow Lite EfficientDet-Lite0 model**

---

## 🎯 Overview

This app is based on the official **[TensorFlow Lite Object Detection Tutorial](https://www.tensorflow.org/lite/android/tutorials/object_detection?hl=ko)**,  
utilizing the **EfficientDet-Lite0** model.  

It was developed as a **standalone demo** of the **main feature (object detection)**  
from the team project **“Chalkak”**, allowing users to experience the core AI functionality  
separately in a lightweight version.

## 📱 Key Features

- Object Detection using **TensorFlow Lite EfficientDet-Lite0**  
- **Select an image from the local gallery** and perform object recognition  
- **Display bounding boxes** and **object labels** for detected objects  
- Compatible with both **Android Emulator** and **physical devices**

---

## 🧩 How It Works

1. The user saves or downloads a photo in the emulator or on their device.  
2. The app allows the user to **select an image from the local gallery**.  
3. Once selected, the image is analyzed using the **TensorFlow Lite0 model**,  
   and the detected objects are **highlighted with bounding boxes**,  
   while their **names are listed on screen**.
